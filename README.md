"Hey everyone! Today I’m presenting a website I created as a flashcard quiz tool. The idea behind the project is to help users study and test their knowledge in a fun and interactive way using flashcards. The site allows users to select a subject and get random questions to answer.

I’ve used HTML and CSS to build the structure and design of the site, and JavaScript to handle the logic behind the flashcard questions, answers, and interactivity. Now I’m going to show you how the JavaScript part works!"
